ComputerBreakReminder
=====================

A simple Windows Forms .NET app that reminds you to take breaks from the computer to help avoid eye strain or dry eyes.

The app reminds you to look away from the screen every 20 minutes, and to take a 5 minute break once an hour.

It's not meant to be pretty, just functional!
